# BookSearch with React

This project is a book search application that allows users to search for books by title, author, and publisher. It uses the Google Books API to fetch data and display the results.

The application is written in React and uses React components to create a user-friendly interface. The search bar allows users to enter their search query and the results are displayed below. The results can be sorted by relevance or by publication date.

The application also allows users to save books to a list for later viewing. This list can be accessed from the navigation bar at the top of the page.

The application is designed to be responsive, so it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

I hope you enjoy using BookSearch with React!
